\Antioch\ takes care of the units for every
parameter thanks to the \Units\ object. This object
enables powerful unit evaluation and conversion,
of a physical quantity as well as an equation.

A description of this object and its dependencies is
given in the \Doxygen\ documentation, thus only a
brief description and some examples will be given here.

The \Units\ objects projects an unit on a unit basis,
defined by the SI system plus radian for angles. There are
three different parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item the symbol of the unit,
\item the power array (basis projection),
\item the coefficient to convert the unit to the basis.
\end{itemize}

All is defined so as to provide an easy use should the user
want to play (or test/analyze) the dimension of some physical
quantity.

The basis is defined as: \unitbase.

The rules for a unit are simple:
\begin{itemize}
\item ``.'' and ``/'' are the separators 
        (thus \verb!m.s-1! and \verb!m/s! are equivalent),
\item it supports grouping with parenthesises.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simple example}

Let's consider an energy for instance, say parameter
$E$ is given in \unit{cal}. You would initialize a \Units\
object by 
\begin{verbatim}
Units<Scalar> E_unit("cal")
\end{verbatim}
\prog{Scalar} being the precision you want, typically \prog{float},
\prog{double} or \prog{long double}. Then you can obtain factors
to any unit that is homogeneous to an energy:
\begin{verbatim}
Scalar j = E_unit.factor_to_some_unit("J"); // j = 4.1868
Scalar strange = E_unit.factor_to_some_unit("g.m2/s2"); // strange = 4.1868e3
Scalar weird = E_unit.factor_to_some_unit("Da.ang2.min-2"); // weird = 9.07686e50
Scalar error = E_unit.factor_to_some_unit("Da.ang.min-2"); 
/*
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Antioch::UnitError'
  what():  Units are not homogeneous:
"cal" and "Da.ang.min-2".
*/ 
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Combining units}

The \Units\ object enables to combine unit
as they would be combined by an equation.


\subsection{Restrictions}
No partial power! The physical senses of it is questionnable
anyway, \Antioch\ will not let you define in any way
a partial power.
