\subsection{So many templates}
\Antioch\ is designed to be extremely flexible as for
the precision and the type of data that is wanted. Therefore
the quantity are all templated, as for state quantities (temperature,
compositions,\dots) as for data, kinetics and transport. This design
is mostly interesting in case of vectorization. A brief summary of the
possibility is given in the reminder of this part.

\subsection{\EIGEN}
\EIGEN\footnote{The \href{eigen.tuxfamily.org}{\EIGEN} library on tuxfamily}
is a powerful and extremely efficient library that is highly advised for
vectorization, if no choice is obvious.

This is a header-only library, as \Antioch\ and is therefore an easy install.

\subsection{\MetaPhysicL}

This library is mostly intended for automatic differenciation.

\subsection{Off to the GPU with \VexCL}
\VexCL\footnote{\href{https://github.com/ddemidov/vexcl}{\VexCL} on github.}
is a header-only library that enables GPU offload. It requires the \Boost\
library and either \ViennaCL\ or \openCL.

\subsection{\GRVY}

For timer purposes.
