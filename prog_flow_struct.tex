\Antioch\ has three levels of objects:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the \prog{Species} objects, used as storage for species 
        physical quantities, per species;
\item the \prog{Mixture} objects, used as storage around the
        species;
\item the \prog{Model} objects, they are the basic equation
        for a physical quantity to be computed, they
        contain the necessary parameters for the calculation;
\item the \prog{Set} objects, they are more or less wrappers
        around the the models, contain the \prog{Mixture} object
        and make the links between the storage and the
        models, if there is a need;
\item the \prog{Evaluator} objects, they are designed to be
        small, on top of all other things, they are but the
        interface to the guts of \Antioch\ to provide
        the information the user wants.
\end{enumerate}

A \prog{Model} object always derives from a \prog{ModelBase}
object, so as to enable multiple choices at run time. The
\prog{Set} object therefore has a \stdvector\ of pointers
of the base objects.
